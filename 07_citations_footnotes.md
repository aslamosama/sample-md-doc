## Sample Text

The shift toward renewable energy has accelerated in recent decades due to growing concerns over climate change and energy sustainability. Fossil fuel consumption has been a primary driver of global CO~2~ emissions, leading to increased efforts to develop cleaner alternatives [@ipcc2021]. Among these, solar and wind energy have seen the most significant growth, thanks to technological advancements and falling production costs. The efficiency of photovoltaic cells has improved dramatically since their invention, with modern panels now converting over 20% of sunlight into electricity[^2]. Similarly, offshore wind farms have emerged as a viable solution to harness stronger and more consistent winds compared to land-based installations [@iea2022].

Despite their benefits, renewable energy sources face challenges related to intermittency and storage. Solar power generation, for example, depends on sunlight availability, which varies based on geographic location and time of day. To address this, researchers are developing more efficient battery storage systems, such as lithium-sulfur and solid-state batteries, to store excess energy for later use[^3]. Pumped hydro storage remains the most widely used large-scale energy storage method, accounting for over 90% of global energy storage capacity [@doe2023renewables]. Additionally, advancements in smart grid technology allow for better energy distribution and demand response, helping to integrate variable renewable sources into the grid more effectively.

Looking ahead, the role of policy and international collaboration will be crucial in scaling renewable energy adoption. Governments worldwide are setting ambitious targets for carbon neutrality, with some aiming to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 [@un2021climate]. Investment in research and development, as well as incentives such as feed-in tariffs and tax credits, are driving further innovation in the sector[^4]. As technology continues to improve and costs decline, renewable energy is expected to play a dominant role in the global energy landscape, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating climate change.

[^2]: Early photovoltaic cells had an efficiency of less than 5%, making them impractical for large-scale electricity generation.

[^3]: Lithium-sulfur batteries have a theoretical energy density up to five times higher than conventional lithium-ion batteries.

[^4]: Countries like Germany and China have implemented aggressive subsidies and policy frameworks to encourage renewable energy adoption.
