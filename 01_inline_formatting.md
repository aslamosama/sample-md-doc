## Sample Text

The **deep ocean** remains one of the least explored places on Earth, covering
over 70% of the planet's surface yet largely shrouded in mystery. At depths
beyond 6,000 meters, known as the _hadal zone_, pressure reaches over 1,000
times the atmospheric pressure at sea level. Creatures here have evolved
extraordinary adaptations to survive, such as the Mariana snailfish, which
thrives in the crushing depths of the Mariana Trench. The chemical composition
of seawater, primarily H~2~O with dissolved gases and salts, plays a crucial
role in sustaining deep-sea ecosystems. Despite the darkness, bioluminescent
organisms create breathtaking underwater spectacles, producing light through
chemical reactions in their bodies.

One of the most fascinating deep-sea creatures is the **colossal squid**, which
can grow up to **_14 meters long and weigh over 500 kg_**. Unlike the more
commonly known giant squid, the colossal squid has larger eyes—about the size of
a dinner plate—allowing it to detect faint light in the abyss. These creatures
possess rotating hooks on their tentacles, making them formidable predators.
Some species of deep-sea fish, like the **barreleye fish**, have transparent
heads, giving them a unique advantage in detecting prey above them.

The immense pressure at 10,000 meters can reach nearly 1.1 × 10^8^ Pascals, a
force that would crush most conventional submarines. Exploring these depths is
challenging due to the immense pressure and harsh conditions. Specially designed
submersibles, such as `DSV Alvin`, allow scientists to study this alien world
firsthand. Advances in autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have made it
possible to map the ocean floor in unprecedented detail. However, deep-sea
exploration remains costly, and funding is often limited. ~~Many potential
discoveries lie hidden, waiting for the right technology and resources to
uncover them~~. From understanding unique adaptations to discovering new
species, the deep ocean holds untapped knowledge that could reshape our
understanding of life on Earth.
