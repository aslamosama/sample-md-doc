## "Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep"

|     Do not stand
|         By my grave, and weep.
|     I am not there,
|         I do not sleep--
| I am the thousand winds that blow
| I am the diamond glints in snow
| I am the sunlight on ripened grain,
| I am the gentle, autumn rain.
| As you awake with morningâ€™s hush,
| I am the swift, up-flinging rush
| Of quiet birds in circling flight,
| I am the day transcending night.
|     Do not stand
|         By my grave, and cry--
|     I am not there,
|         I did not die.
|
| -- Clare Harner, The Gypsy, December 1934
