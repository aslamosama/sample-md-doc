## "Do Not Stand At My Grave And Weep"

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
| Do not stand at my grave and weep,
|   I am not there, I do not sleep.
| I am a thousand winds that blow.
|   I am the diamond glint on snow.
| I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
|   I am the gentle autumn rain.
| When you wake in the morning hush,
|   I am the swift, uplifting rush
| Of quiet birds in circling flight.
|   I am the soft starlight at night.
| Do not stand at my grave and weep.
|   I am not there, I do not sleep.
| (Do not stand at my grave and cry.
|   I am not there, I did not die!)
|
| -- Mary Elizabeth Frye
